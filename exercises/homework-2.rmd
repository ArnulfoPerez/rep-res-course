## Problems to be done for "`r rr_homework_name`" {#ex-test-start}
These are just four fairly basic homework problems to do with indexing. The main
focus of this homework is getting all the GitHub logistics worked out.  

Good luck with this.  I recommend working in groups and helping each other out.

```{r word-comps, rr.question=TRUE}
# here are some github names of people taking the course
gnames <- c("cpetrik", "wildflowermt", "mad4mocha", "sjohnson216", "okisutch99", "sczTWilliams", "rbeas", "mtarjan", "aaronmams", "lslefebvre")

# return a logical vector that gives TRUE for each name that comes after
# the word "github" alphabetically
submit_answer({
  
})

```
