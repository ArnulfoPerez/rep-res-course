# Lists (aka "recursive vectors") {#conflicts-and-remotes} 

* Goals for this lecture
    1. Help everyone get there core editor configured for git
    2. Have everyone create some merge conflicts and resolve them, finding that they
    really aren't a big deal.
    3. Discuss git's rules to avoid clobbering uncommitted work by checking out new branches and let
    everyone play around with _stashing_, git's convenient way to store uncommitted work.
    4. Remote brances: learn how git interacts with remote repositories via
    remote branches. Let everyone set up their very own, distinct repository on GitHub.  


## Configuring your text editor {#intro-to-lists}



## Don't be afraid of merge conflicts {#no-fear-merge-conflicts}



## When git doesn't let me switch branches {#no-switchy-branchy}


## Remote branches

Fetch, Merge, Pull, Push.

Don't forget to talk about tracking branches.  Note that I think that is needed for Rstudio to know where to push to and
pull from.  (otherwise the arrows are greyed out.)
