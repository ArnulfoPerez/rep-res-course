# Factors {#factor-lecture} 


* Goals of this lecture:
    1. Go into moderate detail on _factors_ (A tricky little data structure that
    probably causes more problems than anything else in R.)
        a. What they are / what they look like.
        b. Why we talk about them with _data frames_
        c. How they behave.
        d. Ways that they are useful.
    2. In the process we will look at the `table` function and have some examples
    from the world of _genetic stock identification_ of salmon.
