# Branching and Merging {#branch-and-merge}

## What the heck is a branch? {#whats-a-branch}

* Note that the motto for git is "_local branching on the cheap_," so branches must be important
![branching on the cheap](diagrams/git.png)

* A branch is a "lightweight pointer to a commit"...What?
* Let's refresh our memory on what commits, trees, and blobs are.


### Data structure within the .git folder

* Contents of (different versions of) files in your repository are stored in blobs
* (Sub)directory structure (locations of files in your repository) stored in trees
    + The tree and the blobs referenced in it constitute the "snapshot" of the repository.
* Commits: for a given snapshot, points to a tree, has a comment, an author, a committer, __and__
    + Unless it is the first commit, it has a pointer to a parent.

### A chain or sequence of commits 

![A commit](diagrams/18333fig0302-tn.png)

* The arrows between commits point to parents.  Thus the later commits
are on the right, and the earlier commits on the left.
* This is critical: every commit knows where it came from (the previous commit).
* Just as a genealogy (i.e., links to parents) gives your family history, so too do the commits
_and the links from each commit to its parent(s)_ constitute the __version history__ of your
repository.

### Easy access to commits

* Commits would not be useful if they were just stored in the .git directory of your repository with no way to access them.
* Branches are how you access commits so that you can:
    + Check them out (be able to access their contents)
    + Modify the contents and make a new commit
* They are "lightweight" in that they don't take up much space (each branch is just a file with the sha-1 hash of a commit in it)
* Upon initialization, every repository gets a branch called _master_

![A commit](diagrams/18333fig0303-tn.png)

* It is customary to let _master_ be where your _stable_, deployable code is kept.

### What it means to be _on a branch_

* If you are on a branch, (say _master_ for the sake of argument) that means that
    1. There is a commit pointed to by _master_.  (Let's say it is 8e334ab3)
    2. Any changes you make, __when staged and committed__ will create a new commit
    whose parent (in this case) is 8e334ab3.
* In git, if you are on a branch, then the HEAD points to that branch.

![A commit](diagrams/18333fig0305-tn.png)
    
* Hey, there are two branches pointing to the same commit!
    + That is just fine.  You can have as many branches as you want pointing to a commit.
    + Question.  If changes are committed now, what happens to the two branches? This is crucial...



    
## Creating and using branches {#creating-and-using-branches}

### Creating a branch called "testing"

* In the shell, when you type
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    git branch some-name
    ```
git will make a new branch for you named `some-name`.
* __It will point to whatever commit HEAD currently points to.__ (i.e. the branch that you 
are currently on.)
* Let's do this together.
    1. Create a new rstudio project with version control:
        + File -> New Project -> New Directory -> Empty Project
        + Let the directory name be `branchy` and make it a subdirectory of Desktop.
        + _Important:_ check the box to __"create a git repository"__
    2. At this point there are no commits. Stage `.gitignore` and `branchy.Rproj` and commit them.
    3. Look at the "diff" / History window, and notice that there is one commit and _HEAD_ and _master_
    are at it:
    ![rstudio git hist](diagrams/rs-git-hist-1.png)
    4. Let's "move _master_ forward" by making a new .Rmd file called `simple.Rmd` and committing it.
    Now our history looks like:
    ![rstudio git hist](diagrams/rs-git-hist-2.png)
    5. Now, let's make a new branch called `testing`.  In the shell (in the correct directory):
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        git branch testing
        ```
    Notice that RStudio's git-history shows us that HEAD, master, and testing, all now point to the same
    commit. (__You might have to hit the refresh button__).  They all have the same parent and history too.
    ![branches](diagrams/testy-master.png)
    __However__ the visual there doesn't tell us which branch we are one (where HEAD is attached.)
        + No worries, upper right of the git pane tells us.  We should still be on _master_ because
        we have not "checked-out" the _testing_ branch yet.
        ![branch indicator](diagrams/branch-indicator.png)

### Checking out a branch

* If we want to be _on a branch_ we need to "check that branch out". Either:
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    git checkout testing
    ```
in the shell, or use the dropdown menu by clicking on the __Branch Indicator__ in RStudio.
* In this case nothing exciting happened because _testing_ and _master_ both point to the
same commit.
* If _testing_ had pointed to a different commit, the state of the files in your working area might
have changed.
* What if you had uncommitted changes on some of the files that changed?!!
    + Thankfully, git does not let you overwrite unstored changes when you switch branches. (More on this later.)
    
### Make some changes on the _testing_ branch

1. Make sure you are the _testing_ branch
1. Add some text to the bottom of simple.Rmd
2. Stage that file and commit it
3. Don't stage the "simple.html" file.


### Make __some more__ changes to the _testing_ branch

1. Add some more text to the bottom.  Stage and commit.
2. Don't stage the html file.

### Make even more changes to the testing branch

1. Modify the `.gitignore` file so git ignores all files
that end in `.html` in your repo.

### Now look at your commit history

* Your _testing_ branch has left _master_ in the dust!
![master in the dust](diagrams/master-in-the-dust.png)
* What if, after all of this, we decide that our _testing_
branch is good stuff and we want to add the changes in 
_testing_ to _master_ so we can deploy it, etc?
* This is where merging comes in.



## Merging branches {#merging-branches}

The basic idea of a merge:

1. Switch to the branch that you want to add the stuff into
2. Tell it to merge in changes from another branch (or branches)

* Sometimes this is easy (_fast-forward merges_)
* Sometimes it is more complicated, if both branches
  have changed from their common parent.  But, git
  takes care of most of the details


### Simplest case = Fast-forward merge

* To merge _testing_ into _master_ is simple because 
_master_ is a __direct__ ancestor of _testing_.
* Here is how you do it:
    1. Switch to the master branch (best to make sure your working area is clean)
    2. In the shell (in a directory within the `branchy` repo) type this:
        ```{r, eval=FALSE}
        git merge testing
        ```
* git should tell you that it must made a fast-forward merge:
```
Updating 9f5b2cf..51503c5
Fast-forward
 .gitignore |  1 +
 simple.Rmd | 24 ++++++++++++++++++++++++
 2 files changed, 25 insertions(+)
```

### Look at your history diagram again
* You might have to hit the "Refresh" button in the "RStudio: Review Changes" window.
* See that all that happened is that the _master_ branch has been brought up to where 
the _testing_ branch is.  
* No new commits were generated:


### Harder case, both branches in the merge have moved forward

* Git takes care of the difficulties here (finding the "merge base", etc.)

Note that merging creates a new commit!!
This is as it must and should be!



### Both branches change the same file

* Not a problem unless the same line in the file has been changed in the different branches being merged.

### Merge conflicts

### Resolving merge conflicts

### If we have time...
It is really fun to browse the history for Hadley's advanced R book.
