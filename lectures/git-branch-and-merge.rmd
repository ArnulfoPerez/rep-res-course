# Branching and Merging {#branch-and-merge}

## What the heck is a branch?

* Note that the motto for git is "_local branching on the cheap_," so branches must be important
![branching on the cheap](diagrams/git.png)

* A branch is a "lightweight pointer to a commit"...What?
* Let's refresh our memory on what commits, trees, and blobs are.


### Data structure within the .git folder

* Contents of (different versions of) files in your repository are stored in blobs
* (Sub)directory structure (locations of files in your repository) stored in trees
    + The tree and the blobs referenced in it constitute the "snapshot" of the repository.
* Commits: for a given snapshot, points to a tree, has a comment, an author, a committer, __and__
    + Unless it is the first commit, it has a pointer to a parent.

### A chain or sequence of commits 

![A commit](diagrams/18333fig0302-tn.png)

* The arrows between commits point to parents.  Thus the later commits
are on the right, and the earlier commits on the left.
* This is critical: every commit knows where it came from (the previous commit).
* Just as a genealogy (i.e., links to parents) gives your family history, so too do the commits
_and the links from each commit to its parent(s)_ constitute the __version history__ of your
repository.

### Easy access to commits

* Commits would not be useful if they were just stored in the .git directory of your repository with no way to access them.
* Branches are how you access commits so that you can:
    + Check them out (be able to access their contents)
    + Modify the contents and make a new commit
* They are "lightweight" in that they don't take up much space (each branch is just a file with the sha-1 hash of a commit in it)
* Upon initialization, every repository gets a branch called _master_

![A commit](diagrams/18333fig0303-tn.png)

* It is customary to let _master_ be where your _stable_, deployable code is kept.

### What it means to be _on a branch_

* If you are on a branch, (say _master_ for the sake of argument) that means that
    1. There is a commit pointed to by _master_.  (Let's say it is 8e334ab3)
    2. Any changes you make, __when staged and committed__ will create a new commit
    whose parent (in this case) is 8e334ab3.
* In git, if you are on a branch, then the HEAD points to that branch.

![A commit](diagrams/18333fig0305-tn.png)
    
* Hey, there are two branches pointing to the same commit!
    + That is just fine.  You can have as many branches as you want pointing to a commit.
    + Question.  If changes are committed now, what happens to the two branches? This is crucial...
