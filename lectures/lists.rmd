# Lists (aka "recursive vectors") {#lists-lecture} 



## Introduction to Lists {#intro-to-lists}

* A _list_ in R is a special type of vector.  
* Previously we have seen _atomic vectors_ in which each element is a scalar/singleton and all elements must be of the same mode.
* In a list, each _component_ can be _any object of any sort_!  So, a single component of a list can be an atomic vector, or another list, or a function, or an array, or a data frame, etc.  
* No restriction that the different components of a list be of the same `mode`, or `length`, or `class` or _anything_!
* This makes the `list` class _very powerful (!!)_ and makes lists a _very important_ type of object in R.
* Most high level functions (like `lm` or `hist`, etc.) return their results in lists
    + So, you really need to know how to:
        1. Recognize lists when you see them
        2. Access elements from lists
        3. Operate upon the components of lists
    + You will also want to know how to create and use _lists_ yourself.



### Creating Lists
You use the `list()` function to create a list.
```{r}
# make L an empty list
L <- list()  
L


# make a list of two components
M <- list( c(2,4,6), c("a","b") )
M


# make a list of three components
N <- list( 12, c(3,4), c(T,T,T,F))
N
```


### How R prints lists
* Notice that the i-th component is printed after
  a `[[i]]` in R's output.  
    + Shortly we will see that this explicitly tells us
    how we can extract these values from the list.
* What if a list includes another list as a component?
    ```{r}
    # make a list that has another list as a component
    Q <- list(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
              c("a", "b", "c", "d"),
              list("squish",
                   list("whizz-bang",
                        c(F, F, T)
                        )
                   )
              )
    Q
    ```

### Names for list components

* Just as we saw atomic vectors with a `names` attribute, so too can lists have names.
* You can pass names in to the `list()` function:
    + `list()` takes arguments that are have a `value` or `tag=value` format.  
    + The `tag`s are recorded in the `names` attribute of the list. 
        ```{r}
        # list of 2 named components and one unnamed one
        a <- list( foo = c("q","w"), bar = "MINE!", 3+5*1i )
        
        
        # note that the names of the components are stored in the 
        # list's names attribute. Accessible with the names function
        names(a)  # the names are stored in this attribute
        ```



### Backtrack: you can do the same with _c()_

* In the last lecture, we may not have noted that `names` can be assigned
to the elements of atomic vectors during assignment with `c()`, just like one can with `list()`:
    ```{r}
    # example of assigning names and values with c() 
    weights <- c( onefish = 90, 
                  twofish = 101,
                  redfish = 112, 
                  bluefish = 107
                  )
    weights
  
    # check out the names:
    names(weights)

    ```


### How R prints complex lists with names
Let's recreate our Q list from above, but put
a few names on it (and call it Z):
```{r}
# make a list that has another list as a component
Z <- list(screaming = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
          yellow = c("a", "b", "c", "d"),
          zonkers = list("squish",
                         second = list(a.name = "whizz-bang",
                                       c(F, F, T)
                                       )
                         )
          )
Z
```


## Accessing Parts of Lists with [ ] {#single-chomp}

### The Boxcar analogy
Someone had a nice way of thinking about lists:

* You can think of a list as a train.
* Each component of a list is a boxcar.
* What that component holds is the contents of the boxcar.

The weird thing about this is that inside a boxcar you can have a whole 'nuther train...

* However, it provides a nice way of thinking about the indexing lists
with the different list indexing operators. 

### List indexing operators

* There are `[ ]` and '[[ ]]` and `$`.  
* We will talk about `[ ]` first


### _L[ vec ]_  --- The "standard" indexing operator

* This is what we have been using on atomic vectors.
* When applied to a list the `[ ]` indexing operator
    + Returns a list, stil!
    + Effectively just picks out boxcars from the original list (i.e. original train)
    and links them up (in the order prescribed by the indexing operator) into a new
    train.
* I like to call it the "single-chomp" indexing operator---it's like a pair of jaws that just rips off a chunk of the list but doesn't "chew" into the boxcars at all.

### A diagram might help

* Here is the list `Z` from above.  It is a train with three boxcars:

![list-train.png](diagrams/list-train.png)

* Never mind that the boxcar named "zonkers" has a lot of complicated stuff in it.

* __Now, this is crucial:__ From the perspective of the `[ ]` indexing operator
the train is just a bunch of boxcars.
    + The `[ ]` is agnostic to the contents of the boxcars...
    + When you index it with `[ ]`, the `[ ]` does just what it would
    do with an atomic vector, it just happens that the elements of a _list_
    can be thought of as singleton _lists_, themselves (instead of _logicals_ or _numerics_, etc.)
    
### The way _[ ]_ sees a list:

So, to the `[ ]` ("single-chomp" indexing operator) the list `Z` really
looks like this:

![list-train-agnostic.png](diagrams/list-train-agnostic.png)

Hence if do this `Z[c(3,1)]` you get a list back that looks like:

![list-train-agnostic-3-1.png](diagrams/list-train-agnostic-3-1.png)

And if you had X-ray eyes and were able to peek into each of the boxcars 
of the list `Z[c(3,1)]`, the list would look like this:

![list-train-3-1.png](diagrams/list-train-3-1.png)


### Examples of indexing with _[vec]_ on lists in code

* Consider indexing a list with `[vec]`
* As before, `vec` is a vector that is positive numeric, negative numeric, logical, or character (names)
(recall the four main ways of indexing a vector...)
* So, let's see what it looks like when we index some of the lists we created up above:
```{r}
# first play around with the list N
N


N[c(3,1)]


N[-1]


# now index the list a
a


a[c(T,T)]


a[c("foo", "bar")]


a[c(3,2)]

```

### Summary
* When you index a variable `L` with `[ ]`, then
    + If `L` is a list, the result is a list.
    + If `L` is an atomic vector, the result is an atomic vector.



## Accessing Single Components of Lists with [[ ]]  {#double-chomp}

* Indexing with `[ ]` is all fine and dandy if all we ever want to do is
shuffle boxcars around.
* But, typically, "the goods" are _inside the boxcars!_
* How can we get at what is _in the boxcars_?
* Enter the `[[ ]]` indexing operator.
* If we do `L[[i]]`, then,
    1. We go to boxcar _i_
    2. We open the door of boxcar _i_, pull out _its contents_, and return the contents
    (but not the boxcar "shell")

### Call it a two-chomp extractor...
I think of `[[ ]]` as the "two-chomp" extractor. (which is what it looks like...if `[ ]` is the 
one-chomp extractor) 
    + The first chomp grabs a boxcar
    + The second one chews on the boxcar to "crunch off" its outer shell.  
    
### _[[ i ]]_ only works with single indexes
Here is how I think of it:
* Because `[[ ]]` is "chewing" (to crunch into the boxcar) it can't take too big of a bite
* In fact, it can only chew on a single component of a list (single boxcar) at a time 
* So `i` in `[[i]]` can be only:
    + a single positive integer,  __OR__
    + a single _name_ of a component.
* "Crunching off" its outer shell means it returns the _contents_ of the component, and _not_ a list that contains that component.
    + However, if the contents of the boxcar _is_ another list (for example the "zonkers"
    component in `Z`), then, of course that list gets returned as a list.
        + i.e., it only chews through the outermost boxcar.
```{r}
N[2]  # single chomp


N[[2]] # two chomps (one bite, one chew!)


a["foo"] # single chomp


a[["foo"]] # two chomps

```

#### These would not work
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# indexer for [[ ]] must be of length 1
a[[ c("foo", "bar")]]

a[[c(1, 2)]]

# indexer for [[ ]] cannot be negative
a[[-1]]

# indexer for [[ ]] oughtn't be a logical vector
a[[ TRUE ]]  # this only works because TRUE
             # gets coerced to 1

a[[c(TRUE, TRUE)]] # this returns "q".  Weird subtetly. 
                   # not recommended!

a[[c(TRUE, FALSE)]]  # fails appropriately
```
* __N.B.__ The `[[ ]]` can be used with atomic vectors, but seldom is, as it offers nothing
over `[ ]` in the atomic vector case.




## The $ Two-Chomp Extractor {#dollar-sign}
If you have names on your list, you can use the `$` to
extract _the contents_ of single components like so:
```{r}
a$foo

a$bar

```
Which is convenient if you are typing the name since you don't have to use quotation marks.  But it does not work with names that are stored in objects:
```{r}
i <- "foo"


a$i  # NULL! no component named i


a[[i]] # this returns the same as a$foo
```

### Class Activity:
Given our list Z:
```{r}
Z
```
How can you extract the part whose value is: `"whizz-bang"`.

Do that with _names_, and with _integer indices_, and also
do it with `$` and with ``[[ ]]` and with a combination of both.

Recall that R prints lists with headers that show how you could
access each element.




### The $ extractor might need quotes 
* If the names of the list don't satisfy the requirements for
names of symbols in the R language, then you need to quote them
```{r}
b <- list("my bonny" = 1:3, "lies-over" = 4:9, "the.ocean" = 10:14)

# note when you print it you see the single backticks:
b

# so, this will work:
b$`lies-over`

# but it might be preferable to do
b[["lies-over"]]

# this would fail:  b$lies-over

# Oddly, this works:
b$my

# Why?
```

### $ and name matching
* If the name given to $ is the unique prefix of name in the
list, then it will automagically expand to that
```{r}
silly <- list( here.is.a.stupid.long.name = c(F, T, T),
               here.is.another.stupid.long.name = 4:8
               )

silly$here.is.a.  # this works for here.is.a.stupid.long.name

silly$here.is.an  # this works for here.is.another.stupid.long.name

# these return NULL
silly$here.is.a

silly$here

silly$something.completely.different

silly[["what.is.going.on.here?"]]
```


## Adding or Changing Components {#list-add-or-change}

### You can add a component to a list using _[[ ]]_ or $:
```{r}
length(a)  # number of components


a[["boing"]] <- 1:24


length(a) # it is now one component longer


a$another <- 1:24 > 8 & 1:24 < 13


a[[10]] <- "this is way out there"

```
Adding an element to a list that is beyond its current length pads the rest with `NULL`s


### You can also _replace_ a component using _[[ ]]_ or _$_ 
```{r}
a


a$bar <- "YOURS"

a

```

## Various List Essentials {#list-essentials}

### Catenating lists
* You can use the `c()` operator to catenate lists.  If any argument is a list, then it creates a list
```{r}
c(a,N) # stick those in there

c(a,c("oops", "this", "atomic", "vector", "gets", "listized!"))
```

* Note how different this is than trying to catenate with `list()`
```{r}
z <- list(a,N)  # this makes a new list with two components that are lists!

z[[1]]$another;  # two two-bites!
z[[1]][[5]][11]  # two two-bites and a one-bite!
```


### Coercing To/Away From List

* `as.list()` to coerce an atomic vector to be a list with each component being a scalar:
```{r}
w <- c("this", "is", "only", "a", "test")

as.list(w)  # make a list of the vector
names(w) <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "fish")
as.list(w)  # names are preserved
```

* `unlist()` to "flatten" a list into an atomic vector, coercing mode to the most general. Note that `names` if present get prepended to indexes, and NULL components are omitted:
```{r}
unlist(a)

```
