# Syllabus  {#syllabus}

Here is the outline of the topics, readings, and assignments for our
course.  Readings should be done _before_ the session that they are listed
for.  For example, if it says Reading X is for Tuesday Oct 14, then 
you should have done that reading prior to coming to the class at 
3:30 on Oct 14.  

Most assignments will be "turned in" on GitHub, and will be due at the
time stated.  Don't let this get your blood pressure up.  This course is
not for credit and you will not be graded.  But you will learn a lot more
and you will be far more likely to benefit from using R and git and GitHub if
you do the assignments.


## Week 1 {#syl-week-1}

### `r  course_day("Tu", 1)`
_Introduction and Welcome. R and Rstudio very basics_

* __Assignment Due:__ [Assignment 0](#assignment-0).  Please have all software installed before showing up to the first class.
* __Assignment Given (Due by noon on Wednesday):__ [Assignment 1](#assignment-1)
* __Lectures:__
    + [Introduction](#intro-lecture)
    + [Rstudio Orientation](#rstudio-orientation)


### `r  course_day("Th", 1)`
_An introduction to R markdown_

* __Assignment Due:__ [Assignment 2](#assignment-2). There is nothing to turn in, but I want everyone to do this.
* __Assignment Given (Please finish by Wednesday night next week!):__ [Assignment 3](#assignment-3).
  You will write about yourself and your research using R markdown.
* __Lectures:__
    + [R Markdown in an Hour](#rmarkdown-in-an-hour)
 
## Week 2 {#syl-week-2}

### `r  course_day("Tu", 2)`
_Atomic data types, Vectorization, Indexing in R_

* __Reading:__ By this class, I would like you to have read the [Introduction](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html) to Hadley Wickham's advanced R book, up to, but not including, "Meta-techniques". Then, please read through [Data structures](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html) up to "Attributes".  This is very terse and will likely feel foreign to most newcomers to R, but precisely because it is short and compact (and very informative) it is worth coming back to frequently.  We will go over the topics in more detail.
* __Lectures:__
    + [Atomic Data Modes and Coercion](#r-data-types-and-coercion)
    + [Vectorization, Recycling, and Indexing](#vectorization-and-indexing)


### `r  course_day("Th", 2)`
_git Overview.  Configuring git_

* __Reading:__ Read sections 1.1 through 1.3 in the [Pro Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book) which is online and free.
* __Assignment Due:__ [Assignment 3](#assignment-3). You should have completed this the day before this course session.
* __Lectures:__
    + [Git Basics](#git-basics)


## Week 3 {#syl-week-3}

### `r  course_day("Tu", 3)`
_Attributes. Length of vectors. Names_

* __Assignment Due:__ _Exercise Set 1_, named [Trial Homework](#ex-test-start).  I emailed this out to people Saturday night.  I would like everyone
to try to complete it by Tuesday.  At least give it a whirl.  It is called
Trial Homework because it is not very long.  Mostly the goal is to figure out how
to commit your changes and make a GitHub pull request. It would be good to be
able to discuss it in class after everyone has at least tried to complete it.
* __Lectures:__
    + [length() and names()](#attr-length-names)
    + [Comments on the homework](#trial-homework-thoughts)

### `r  course_day("Th", 3)`
_git: Branching and Merging_

* __Reading__:  I don't expect people
to have finished this reading before class because I didn't post it till Thursday.  We will be covering material
in these readings, so it would be good for you to read one or both of them to solidify ideas.  Either:
    + Read chapter 3 of the [Pro Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book). 
    + __OR__
    + Read [this excellent tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) on branching and merging    
    + __OR__ read them both.
* __Lecture:__
    + [Branching and merging](#branch-and-merge)



## Week 4 {#syl-week-4}

### `r  course_day("Tu", 4)`
_Lists: aka "recursive vectors"_

* __Reading__: In case you were wondering why you are going through the grueling
work of learning R and git, Devon Pearse found this excellent post from Carly Strasser
at the California Digital Library that makes a good case for sticking with it!
http://datapub.cdlib.org/2014/10/14/the-10-things-every-new-grad-student-should-do/
